# Professional Portfolio 

For my first project i decided to build a website that would showcase my artwork to 
prospective employers. The idea behind the website is to stand out from the crowd, be easily contactable and show my work in a clean and efficient way. I want to provide a good user experience.

From personal experience it's incredibly  difficult to get noticed in the industry. I wanted the website to be simplistic and easy to navigate so employers will stick around and view everything i have to display on the site. I want to have an appealing landing page to keep the viewers attention so they will look deeper in to the website.


## UX
The UX was extremely important in this project. I wanted to make a positive user experience so the user would keep coming back for example when new pieces of art would be uploaded etc.

i wanted navigation to be the same in every part of the website so as not to confuse and potentially irritate users. I want to achieve a smooth experience for employers who wont be put off by confusing navigation and to get the information they require in as few clicks as possible.

Each section has its own topic such as sketchbook, finished art etc. each containing only one topic to clearly separate then which i believe is more pleasing than having multiple topics on one page.


In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As an Employer on the website I want the ability to see clearly what the talent level, design process and materials used so that I may progress contacting the person for work. **End user goal:** investigate whether we can work with this person**End business goal:** Gainful employment and exposure **Acceptance criteria:** * Keep uploading new artwork * upload process videos * spread online profile*

As someone who is interested in the art pieces on the website I want the ability to buy prints and pay with a credit card, so that I may immediately confirm my purchase. **End user goal:** Purchase items with a credit card **End business goal:** Increase purchases, extra money **Acceptance criteria:** * Accept Discover, Visa, MC * Validate credit card number * Validate expiration data and CVV * Validate billing address * Generate success/failure messages after processing

As a new visitor to the website, I want view this artist's gallery, and view their work in detail so I can decide if I want to commission their work.

As a new visitor to the website, I want learn more about the artist, so I can feel I connect with her as a person.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features

The features of my site are as follows:

- Home: This is the landing page for my site. It shows an avatar i made and a description of my skills followed by contact details in the footer
- Sketchbook: This is where i hold my work in progress or not finished designs to show the user my thought process. When you click the image it opens full size on another tab.
- Finished Art: This is where i put all my final pieces completed. Again when you click the image it opens full size in a new tab.
- Process: This is where i put my videos of time lapsed process videos of me working and completing a piece.

### Existing Features

-   Feature 1 - allows users to see the navigation bar by clicking the nav button.
-   Feature 2 - Allows users to see a full sized image when they click an image.


- Some new features i might include would be a payment method to order prints through the website.
- Also a feature that would tell you more about materials used and time to complete when you hover over an image.

### Features Left to Implement

-  Adding search feature to site for easy and quick reference to artwork.

## Technologies Used

The technologies used in the creation of this website was HTML and CSS. I also imported from google fonts, font awesome and bootstrap.

-   [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
    -   The project uses  **Bootstrap**  to add grid layout and extra foundation work.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
       -   The project uses  **Font Awesome**  to add social buttons and extra flourishes to the navigation bar.
       
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/?selection.family=Roboto/)
       -   The project uses  **Google Fonts**  to add extra fonts to the site.
              

## Testing

I have conducted a lot of testing since the start of this project. Usually this would mean i would add extra features then save and then test how it looks and how it responds both in mobile and desktop modes.

I would test after every piece of code. As per the user stories it shouldn't be too difficult to add more artwork. To open the artwork on a separate tab was easy enough as i added a target="_blank" to each piece so it would open and make it easy to close and get back to what they were looking at.
This worked in both desktop and mobile screens in full screen.

I also tested the navigation bar to see if it would react to mobile display. i would go into dev tools and make the screen responsive so i could move the screen size in and out and see if the nav items would disappear behind a button that would make the screen look cleaner and more ideal for a mobile experience.

I had a lot of problems getting my site to work properly on different screen sizes as i didnt fully understand the grid system on bootstrap and found it difficult to align things properly and keep the footer stuck to the bottom. Other problems encountered was getting my back ground image to behave in mobile view.

i sent a link to friends and family and asked them to use the website and give feedback on what they thought needed to improve or any stumbling blocks they'd encountered.

Most of these problems were remedied by researching the issue and adding the relevant bootstrap snippets or simple fixes such as entering the correct path to my css file.

The devices i used to test the website was a macbook pro and iPhone XS Max



## Deployment

The deployment was straight forward enough. i set up a file system through git and made regular git commits
